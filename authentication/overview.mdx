## Authentication Methods

    Direct company access for merchants managing their own receipts
  </Card>
  <Card title="OAuth 2.0" icon="shield-halved" href="/authentication/oauth">
    Third-party access for POS systems and integrators
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Choosing the Right Method

### Use API Keys When:

- ✅ You are the **merchant** integrating your own POS system
- ✅ You need to **send receipts** from your own systems
- ✅ You manage **multiple store locations** or a **franchise organization**

**Examples:** 
- A restaurant owner integrating their own POS system to send digital receipts
- A franchise organization like Domino's managing receipts for all franchise locations from a centralized system

### Use OAuth 2.0 When:

- ✅ You are a **third-party** building an integration for multiple merchants
- ✅ You want merchants to **authorize your application** to start issuing receipts for them
- ✅ You are building a **POS system, accounting software, or marketplace integration**

**Example:** A POS system provider offering Cheqi integration to all their customers.

## Security Comparison

| Feature | API Keys | OAuth 2.0 |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Setup Complexity** | Simple | Moderate |
| **Access Scope** | Full company + child stores | Granular scopes per company |
| **Multi-Store Support** | Yes (parent + all child stores) | Yes (per authorized company) |
| **User Authorization** | Not required | Required per merchant |
| **Token Expiration** | Never (until revoked) | Access tokens expire |
| **Refresh Tokens** | N/A | Yes |
| **Best For** | Direct merchant integration, franchises | Third-party platforms |
